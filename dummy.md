# Dummy page for testing

Some test. 6

Does this work?

# Header

More text

## Subheader

And even more text.

```
a = b
```

And here is some maths: first inline $x = \psi_y(k)$ and some 
equation:

 $$A = \sum_{i=1}^n f_i$$

Does it work?

Also a proper equation like this maybe:

\begin{equation}
   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle
\end{equation}
