# Dummy page for testing

Some test. 10

Some (text) here

Does this work?

OK this is page.url: {{ page.url }} and this is site.url {{ site.url }}
and this is page.canonical_url {{ page.canonical_url }} 

# Header

More text

## Subheader

And even more text.

```
a = b
```

And here is some maths: first inline $x = \psi_y(k)$ and some other inline \\( \psi_y(k) \\) and some 
equation:

$$
A = \sum_{i=1}^n f_i
$$

Does it work?

Some inline maths with double dollar sign: $$ x = \ps $$ -- does this work?

Also a proper equation like this maybe:

\begin{equation}
   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle
\end{equation}

and some inline maths using a single backslash \( \psi_y(k) \)
