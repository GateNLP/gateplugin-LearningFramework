# Tutorial on Part-Of-Speech Tagging

**NOTE: this tutorial is currently under construction!!**

The aim of this tutorial is to help with the following:
* Understand what the Part-Of-Speec tagging task is
* Apply different machine learning algorithms to the problem:
  Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, CRF
* Understand the difference between algorithms that deal with 
  individual instances and those that deal with sequences of instances.
* Understand how to generate additional features and use a window-based
  approach to classification
* Understand how to evaluate the quality of a learned model
* Understand how choosing the features and hyperparameters influences
  the quality of a learned model
* Apply neural network approaches to the problem
* Understand the influence of hyperparameters, network architecture and
  optimization strategy when using a neural network
