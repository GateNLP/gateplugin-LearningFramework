# GateNLP - Learning Framework Plugin

This is the home page of the web-site for the GateNLP LearningFramework plugin.
This web-site about the LearningFramework is work in progress and growing. 

NOTE: This web-ste will eventually contain all the documentation about the plugin plus 
additional tutorials and blog posts. The documentation was originally (and still largely is)
located on the GitHub [Wiki for the project](https://github.com/GateNLP/gateplugin-LearningFramework/wiki) 
but will be restructured so that only documentation relevant to developers of the plugin
remains in the wiki and end-user documentation is all gathered on this site.

You can find the plugin and additional information:
* [The GitHub source code repository](https://github.com/GateNLP/gateplugin-LearningFramework) 
* [Release Downloads](https://github.com/GateNLP/gateplugin-LearningFramework/releases)
* [Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/GateNLP/gateplugin-LearningFramework/wiki)
