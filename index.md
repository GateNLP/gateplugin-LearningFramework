# GateNLP - Learning Framework Plugin

This is the home page for the GateNLP LearningFramework plugin.

The GATE LearningFramework plugin is a plugin for the [GATE](https://gate.ac.uk/) NLP platform.
It supports a number of machine learning tasks relevant to NLP (classification, sequence tagging, regression)
and provides a consistent way to use a broad range of machine learning algorithms from
several libraries to perform to tasks.

NOTE: This web site provides the most recent documentation for the plugin. We try
to keep the documentation up-to-date with the most recent version of the plugin.
The documentation on this web site is mainly intended for users of the LearningFramework.
Developer-specific documentation is kept in the [GitHub Wiki for the project](https://github.com/GateNLP/gateplugin-LearningFramework/wiki).
